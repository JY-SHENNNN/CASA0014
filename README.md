# CASA0014
This is used for CASA0014 Connected Environments 
The general idea is to use two touchpads to control the chrono lumina:
* single click
  - single click LEFT: turn on the default light
  - single click Right: turn off the all light
* double click
  - double click LEFT: all random
  - double click RIGHT: stop the previous setting value
* swipe
  - from LEFT to RIGHT: dynamic 12 color circuit
  - from RIGHT to LEFT: breath light
* long press
  - both: alter the brightness
