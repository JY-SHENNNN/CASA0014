# CASA0014
This is used for CASA0014 Connected Environments 
## interact with Internet of Things (Overview)
* Objective: Enhance user interaction with IoT system through Chrono Lumina light, controlled by touch sensors, reflecting activities in Lab environment
* Aim: provide visual feedback using dynamic lighting to encourage user enperimentation and exploration with IoT.

## Interaction Mode
The general idea is to use two touchpads to control the chrono lumina, which reflects the current thinking in mind.
* single click: No idea or offline
  - single click 1: turn on the default light
  - single click 2: turn off the all light
* double click: researching or brainstorming to finish
  - double click 1: all random
  - double click 2: dynamic 12 color circuit
* swipe: more clearer idea or idea but with problem
  - from 2 to 1: decrease brightness
  - from 1 to 2: increase brightness

## Inspiration
- science museum environmental light -> stong sense of immersive experience
- differnet displayed item with differnt environmental lights -> creating emotional resonance
Every exhibit has a different story, just as our own experiences reveal different ideas

## Equipment
* Touchpad TTP223B
* Arduino MKR1010
* Jump wires

## System architecture
